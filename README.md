## Signing up for ThumbWhere

Before you can begin, you must sign up for each service you want to use.

To sign up for a service:

(You can't currently sign up - we are in closed trials - but the signing process will be something like this)

* Go to the home page for the service. You can find a list of services on
  [thumbwhere.com/products](http://thumbwhere/products).
* Click the Sign Up button on the top right corner of the page. If you don't already have an TW account, you
  are prompted to create one as part of the sign up process.
* Follow the on-screen instructions.
* TW sends you a confirmation e-mail after the sign-up process is complete. At any time, you can view your
  current account activity and manage your account by going to [admin.thumbwhere.com](http://admin.thumbwhere.com) and
  clicking "Your Account".
* You then need to configure your ThumbWhere account informaton into the Admin Panel for the ThumbWhere module in Drupal.
